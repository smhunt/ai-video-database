# Archive

This folder contains the original video editing capabilities from the [Diffusion Studio Video Composer Agent](https://github.com/diffusionstudio/agent) that we forked this project from.

## What's Here

### video-editing-examples/
Example scripts showing how to use the Diffusion Studio API for:
- Creating title sequences
- Split screen effects
- Highlight reels
- Video composition

These are preserved for reference but are not part of the main AI Video Database functionality.

### original-docs/
- Original documentation from Diffusion Studio
- Asset files used in the video editing examples
- Embeddings for the documentation search feature

## Why Did We Archive This?

We shifted our focus from video **composition/editing** to video **database/search**.

Instead of creating and editing videos, we now:
- Upload and analyze videos with AI
- Search through video content semantically
- Chat with videos using natural language
- Build a searchable video database

The original video editing tools are awesome, but they're just not our jam anymore. We're all about that database life now. 🗄️

## Want to Use the Video Editing Features?
