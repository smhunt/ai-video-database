## Setup

```bash
pip install uv
```

```bash
uv sync
```

or alternatively:

```bash
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment Variables

You will need to use the environment variables defined in `.env.example` to run AI Video Database. It's recommended you use Vercel Environment Variables for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

**Note:** You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

## Run Agent

To run the main script:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

Feel free to modify the `main.py` script to add new tools and modify the agent's behavior.

## Documentation Search

The documentation search system provides semantic search capabilities for Diffusion Studio's documentation:

### Usage
```python
from src.tools.docs_search import DocsSearchTool

# Initialize search tool
docs_search = DocsSearchTool()

# Basic search
results = docs_search.forward(query="how to add text overlay")

# With reranking for more accurate results
results = docs_search.forward(query="how to add text overlay", rerank_results=True)

# Limit number of results
results = docs_search.forward(query="how to add text overlay", limit=10)

# With filters
results = docs_search.forward(
    query="video transitions",
    filter_conditions={"section": "video-effects"}
)
```

The search tool:
- Uses vector embeddings for fast semantic search
- Supports optional semantic reranking for higher accuracy
- Allows filtering by documentation sections
- Auto-embeds documentation from configured URL
- Maintains embedding cache with hash checking

## Development

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup and guidelines.

## ToDos PRs Welcome
- [ ] Make python agent fully [async](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/issues/145)
- [ ] Add TS implementation of agent
- [ ] Stream the console logs of browser back to the agent
- [ ] Add support for feedback for more modalities like audio
  - [ ] Speech to text to remove certain centences
  - [ ] Waveform analysis to sync audio to video
  - [ ] Moderation analysis to remove certain phrases
- [ ] Add [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) integration
    > MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
- [ ] Add [BM25](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/skills/contextual-embeddings/guide.ipynb) to `DocsSearchTool` to enable hybrid search
- [ ] Add support for video understanding models like [VideoLLaMA](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/VideoLLaMA3)
